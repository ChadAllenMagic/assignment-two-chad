Hello Kevin,
Today is Friday, May 31st 2024. We had a good call today regarding a new project for me to develop with your support. 

We discussed the following: 
1. Using dev tools in the DOM 
Starting simple and building from there 
Mancala the board game was mentioned but probably best to attempt after learning arrays
Instead, we agreed upon a coin tracker 

SPECS FOR THE COIN TRACKER 
Generate a flipping action to determine whether a coin is heads-up or tails 
Track the amount of coin flips and their result 
Generate a UI designing it in both CSS and HTML 
Keep it simple to start 

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS 
Upon thinking about this further, it would be nice to have a image of each coin flipped as well 
Maybe it would also be nice to choose the kind of coins to use for the flip: penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, etc. 
A sound effect for the flipping of the coin might be nice as well but not necessary. 
The ability to flip multiple coins might be nice as well. 
Create a silly game where different coins compete against each other 
Penny versus Quarter for example 
Run one hundred coin flips to see who wins? Will it always be a tie game? 


ADDITIONAL NOTE
I have not learned to share repos in Node yet. I'll try and figure that out. In the meantime, I know assignment-two is shared with you so I'll put everything in this directory for the moment.
